			<p>As Germinie was returning to the house one morning at daybreak, she heard, from the shadows of the <i xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> as it closed behind her, a voice cry: “Who’s that?” She ran to the servants’ staircase, but found that she was pursued, and as she turned a corner on the landing the concierge seized her. As soon as he recognized her, he said: “Oh! is it you? excuse me; don’t be frightened! What a giddy creature you are! It surprises you to see me up so early, eh? It’s on account of the thieving that’s going on these days in the cook’s bedroom on the second. Good night to you! it’s lucky for you I don’t tell all I know.”</p>
			<p>A few days later Germinie learned through Adèle that the husband of the cook who had been robbed said that there was no need to look very far; that the thief was in the house, and that he knew what he knew. Adèle added that it was making a good deal of talk in the street and that there were plenty of people who would believe it and repeat it. Germinie became very indignant and told her mistress all about it. Mademoiselle was even more indignant than she, and, feeling personally outraged by the insult, wrote instantly to the cook’s mistress that she must put a stop at once to the slanderous statements concerning a girl who had been in her service twenty years, and for whom she would answer as for herself. The cook was reprimanded. Her husband in his wrath talked louder than ever. He made a great outcry and for several days filled the house with his project of going to the commissioner of police and calling upon him to question Germinie as to where she procured the money to start the <i xml:lang="fr">crémière’s</i> son in business, as to where she procured the money to purchase a substitute for him, and how she paid the expenses of the men she kept. For a whole week the terrible threat hung over Germinie’s head. At last the thief was discovered and the threat fell to the ground. But it had had its effect on the poor girl. It had done all the injury it could do in that confused brain, where, under the sudden, overpowering rush of the blood, her reason was wavering and became overcast at the slightest shock. It had overturned that brain which was so prompt to go astray in fear or vexation, which lost so quickly the faculty of good judgment, of discernment, clear-sightedness and appreciation of its surroundings, which exaggerated its troubles, which plunged into foolish alarms, previsions of evil, despairing presentiments, which looked upon its terrors as realities, and was constantly lost in the pessimism of that species of delirium, at the end of which it could find nothing but this ejaculation and this phrase: “Bah! I will kill myself!”</p>
			<p>Throughout the week the fever in her brain caused her to experience all the effects of the things she thought might happen. By day and night she saw her shame laid bare and made public; she saw her secret, her cowardice, her wrongdoing, all that she carried about with her concealed and sewn in her heart⁠—she saw it all uncovered, noised abroad, disclosed⁠—disclosed to mademoiselle! Her debts on Jupillon’s account, augmented by her debts for drink and for food for Gautruche, by all that she purchased now on credit, her debt to the concierge and the shopkeepers would soon become known and ruin her! A cold shiver ran down her back at the thought: she could feel mademoiselle turning her away! Throughout the week she constantly imagined herself standing before the commissioner of police. Seven long days she brooded over that word and that idea: the Law! the Law as it appears to the imagination of the lower classes; something terrible, indefinable, inevitable, which is everywhere, and lurks in everyone’s shadow; an omnipotent source of calamity which appears vaguely in the judge’s black gown, between the police sergeant and the executioner, with the hands of the gendarme and the arms of the guillotine! She, who was subject to all the instinctive terrors of the common people, and who often repeated that she would much rather die than appear before the court⁠—she imagined herself seated in the dock, between two gendarmes, in a courtroom, surrounded by all the unfamiliar paraphernalia of the Law, her ignorance of which made them objects of terror to her. Throughout the week her ears heard footsteps on the stairs coming to arrest her!</p>
			<p>The shock was too violent for nerves as weak as hers. The mental upheaval of that week of agony possessed her with an idea that hitherto had only hovered about her⁠—the idea of suicide. She began to listen, with her head in her hands, to the voice that spoke to her of deliverance. She opened her ears to the sweet music of death that we hear in the background of life like the fall of mighty waters in the distance, dying away in space. The temptations that speak to the discouraged heart of the things that put an end to life so quickly and so easily, of the means of quelling suffering with the hand, pursued and solicited her. Her glance rested wistfully upon all the things about her that could cure the disease called life. She accustomed her fingers and her lips to them. She touched them, handled them, drew them near to her. She sought to test her courage upon them and to obtain a foretaste of death. She would remain for hours at her kitchen window with her eyes fixed on the pavements in the courtyard down at the foot of the five flights⁠—pavements that she knew and could have distinguished from others! As the daylight faded she would lean farther out bending almost double over the ill-secured window-bar, hoping always that it would give way and drag her down with it⁠—praying that she might die without having to make the desperate, voluntary leap into space to which she no longer felt equal.</p>
			<p>“Why, you’ll fall out!” said mademoiselle one day, grasping her skirt impulsively in her alarm. “What are you looking at down there in the courtyard?”</p>
			<p>“Oh! nothing⁠—the pavements.”</p>
			<p>“In Heaven’s name, are you crazy? How you frightened me!”</p>
			<p>“Oh! people don’t fall that way,” said Germinie in a strange tone. “I tell you, mademoiselle, in order to fall one must have a mighty longing to do it!”</p>
