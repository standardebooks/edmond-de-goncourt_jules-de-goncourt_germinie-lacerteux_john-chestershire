			<p>On Wednesday morning, when she came downstairs, Germinie found a letter for herself. In that letter, written on the back of a laundry receipt, the Remalard woman informed her that her child had fallen sick almost immediately after her departure; that she had grown steadily worse; that she had consulted the doctor; that he said some insect had stung the child; that she had been to him a second time; that she did not know what more to do; that she had had pilgrimages made for her. The letter concluded thus: “If you could see how troubled I am for your little one⁠—if you could see how good she is when she isn’t suffering!”</p>
			<p>This letter produced upon Germinie the effect of a push from behind. She went out and instinctively walked toward the railroad that would take her to her little one. Her hair was uncombed and she was in her slippers, but she did not think of that. She must see her child, she must see her instantly. Then she would come back. She thought of mademoiselle’s breakfast for a moment, then forgot it. Suddenly, halfway to the station, she saw a clock at a cab office and noticed the hour: she remembered that there was no train at that time. She retraced her steps, saying to herself that she would hurry the breakfast and then make some excuse to be given her liberty for the rest of the day. But when the breakfast was served she could find none: her mind was so full of her child that she could not invent a falsehood; her imagination was benumbed. And then, if she had spoken, if she had made the request, she would have betrayed herself; she could feel the words upon her lips: “I want to go and see my child!” At night she dared not make her escape; mademoiselle had been a little indisposed the night before; she was afraid that she might need her.</p>
			<p>The next morning when she entered mademoiselle’s room with a fable she had invented during the night, all ready to ask for leave of absence, mademoiselle said to her, looking up from a letter that had just been sent up to her from the lodge: “Ah! my old friend De Belleuse wants you for the whole day today, to help her with her preserves. Come, give me my two eggs, posthaste, and off with you. Eh? what! doesn’t that suit you? What’s the matter?”</p>
			<p>“With me? why nothing at all!” Germinie found strength to say.</p>
			<p>All that endless day she passed standing over hot stewpans and sealing up jars, in the torture known only to those whom the chances of life detain at a distance from the sick bed of those dear to them. She suffered such heartrending agony as those unhappy creatures suffer who cannot go where their anxiety calls them, and who, in the extremity of despair caused by separation and uncertainty, constantly imagine that death will come in their absence.</p>
			<p>As she received no letter Thursday evening and none Friday morning, she took courage. If the little one were growing worse the nurse would have written her. The little one was better: she imagined her saved, cured. Children are forever coming near dying, and they get well so quickly! And then hers was strong. She decided to wait, to be patient until Sunday, which was only forty-eight hours away, deceiving the remainder of her fears with the superstitions that say yes to hope, persuading herself that her daughter had “escaped,” because the first person she met in the morning was a man, because she had seen a red horse in the street, because she had guessed that a certain person would turn into a certain street, because she had ascended a flight of stairs in so many strides.</p>
			<p>On Saturday, in the morning, when she entered Mère Jupillon’s shop, she found her weeping hot tears over a lump of butter that she was covering with a moist cloth.</p>
			<p>“Ah! it’s you, is it?” said Mère Jupillon. “That poor charcoal woman! See, I’m actually crying over her! She just went away from here. You don’t know⁠—they can’t get their faces clean in their trade with anything but butter. And here’s her love of a daughter⁠—she’s at death’s door, you know, the dear child. That’s the way it is with us! Ah! <i xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>, yes!⁠—Well, as I was saying, she said to her just now like this: ‘Mamma, I want you to wash my face in butter right away⁠—for the good God.’ ”</p>
			<p>And Mère Jupillon began to sob.</p>
			<p>Germinie had fled. All that day she was unable to keep still. Again and again she went up to her chamber to prepare the few things she proposed to take to her little one the next day, to dress her cleanly, to make a little special toilet for her in honor of her recovery. As she went down in the evening to put Mademoiselle to bed, Adèle handed her a letter that she had found for her below.</p>
