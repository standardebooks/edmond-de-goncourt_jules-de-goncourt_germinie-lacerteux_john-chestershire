			<p>Mademoiselle talked and prayed and implored and scolded to no purpose: she could not induce Germinie to lay aside her work for a few days. Germinie would not even listen to the suggestion that she should have an assistant to do the heavier work. She declared that it was useless, impossible; that she could never endure the thought of another woman approaching her, waiting upon her, attending to her wants; that it would give her a fever simply to think of such a thing as she lay in bed; that she was not dead yet; and she begged that she might be allowed to go on as usual, so long as she could put one foot before the other. She said it in such an affectionate tone, her eyes were so beseeching, her feeble voice was so humble and so passionate in making the request, that mademoiselle had not the courage to force her to accept an assistant. She simply called her a “blockhead,” who believed, like all country-people, that a few days in bed means death.</p>
			<p>Keeping on her feet, with an apparent improvement due to the physician’s energetic treatment, Germinie continued to make mademoiselle’s bed, accepting her assistance to turn the mattresses. She also continued to prepare her food, and that was an especially distasteful task to her.</p>
			<p>When she was preparing mademoiselle’s breakfast and dinner, she felt as if she should die in her kitchen, one of the wretched little kitchens common in great cities, which are the cause of so much pulmonary trouble in women. The embers that she kindled, and from which a thread of suffocating smoke slowly arose, began to stir her stomach to revolt; soon the charcoal that she bought from the charcoal dealer next door, strong Paris charcoal, full of half-charred wood, enveloped her in its stifling odor. The dirty, smoking funnel, the low chimneypiece poured back into her lungs the corroding heat of the waist-high oven. She suffocated, she felt the fiery heat of all her blood surge upward to her face and cause red blotches to appear on her forehead. Her head whirled. In the half-asphyxiated condition of laundresses who pass back and forth through the vapor of their charcoal stoves, she would rush to the window and draw a few breaths of the icy outside air.</p>
			<p>She had other motives for suffering on her feet, for keeping constantly about her work despite her increasing weakness, than the repugnance of country-people to take to their beds, or her fierce, jealous determination that no one but herself should attend to mademoiselle’s needs: she had a constant terror of denunciation, which might accompany the installation of a new servant. It was absolutely necessary that she should be there, to keep watch on mademoiselle and prevent anyone from coming near her. It was necessary, too, that she should show herself, that the quarter should see her, and that she should not appear to her creditors with the aspect of a dead woman. She must make a pretence of being strong, she must assume a cheerful, lively demeanor, she must impart confidence to the whole street with the doctor’s studied words, with a hopeful air, and with the promise not to die. She must appear at her best in order to reassure her debtors and to prevent apprehensions on the subject of money from ascending the stairs and applying to mademoiselle.</p>
			<p>She acted up to her part in this horrible, but necessary, comedy. She was absolutely heroic in the way she made her whole body lie⁠—in drawing up her enfeebled form to its full height as she passed the shops, whose proprietors’ eyes were upon her; in quickening her trailing footsteps; in rubbing her cheeks with a rough towel before going out in order to bring back the color of blood to them; in covering the pallor of her disease and her death-mask with rouge.</p>
			<p>Despite the terrible cough that racked her sleepless nights, despite her stomach’s loathing for food, she passed the whole winter conquering and overcoming her own weakness and struggling with the ups and downs of her disease.</p>
			<p>At every visit that he made, the doctor told mademoiselle that he was unable to find that any of her maid’s vital organs were seriously diseased. The lungs were a little ulcerated near the top; but people recovered from that. “But her body seems worn out, thoroughly worn out,” he said again and again, in a sad tone, with an almost embarrassed manner that impressed mademoiselle. And he always had something to say, at the end of his visit, about a change of air⁠—about the country.</p>
